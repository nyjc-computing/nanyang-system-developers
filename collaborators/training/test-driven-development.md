# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process characterized by the practice of writing tests prior to writing the actual code. TDD follows a repeated cycle and relies heavily on automated testing.

## TDD Cycle

The cycle commonly associated with TDD consists of three distinct steps:

1. **Write a Test**: Start by writing a test for the new function. This test is initially expected to fail, ensuring that the new code is necessary and that the test is effective.

2. **Write Code**: Write the minimum amount of code required to pass the test. This step often leads to simplified and efficient coding.

3. **Refactor**: Once the test is passed, refactor the code for improvement, ensuring that it remains efficient, clean, and adheres to coding standards. Repeat the cycle for new functionalities.

## Benefits of TDD

- **Improved Code Quality**: By writing tests first, developers focus on the desired functionality without over-engineering, often leading to better code quality.

- **Early Bug Detection**: Tests written beforehand help catch errors early in the development process, reducing debugging time and effort later.

- **Better Design**: TDD encourages thinking about the design and architecture of code from the outset, potentially leading to superior design.
