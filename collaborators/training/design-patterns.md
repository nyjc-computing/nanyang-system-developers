# Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. They are not finished designs that can be transformed directly into code but are templates for how to solve a problem in many different situations.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Reusability**: Design patterns provide solutions that can be reused in multiple projects.
- **Efficiency**: They help speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
- **Communication**: Design patterns provide a common language for developers, making it easier to communicate complex ideas.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns can be classified into three main categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition or the way to realize relationships between entities.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities among objects.

## Common Design Patterns

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
