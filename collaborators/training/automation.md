# Simple Automation Guidelines for Student Developers

## Overview

When creating small to medium applications, automation should help make your development process easier without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Key Principles

### 1. Start Simple
- Automate repetitive tasks like testing and builds
- Keep automation scripts simple and easy to understand
- Focus on time-saving opportunities

### 2. Maintain Control
- Include ways to run processes manually if needed
- Keep automation optional rather than mandatory
- Document how automated processes work

### 3. Focus on Development Tasks
- Automate test runs
- Set up simple build processes
- Create basic deployment scripts
- Automate code formatting and linting

### 4. Test Before Implementing
- Try processes manually first
- Automate only what you understand well
- Start with basic scripts before adding complexity

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation**
   - Write clear comments in automation scripts
   - Document how to run processes manually
   - Keep instructions simple and direct

2. **Testing**
   - Test automated processes thoroughly
   - Have a way to verify results
   - Keep test runs simple and focused

3. **Maintenance**
   - Review automation scripts regularly
   - Update as project needs change
   - Remove unused automation

## Implementation Tips

1. Start with basic task runners
2. Use built-in IDE automation features
3. Keep scripts in a single, organized location
4. Test frequently during development

Remember: For small-to-medium-scale projects, simple and reliable automation is better than complex systems. Focus on automating tasks that directly help your development process.
