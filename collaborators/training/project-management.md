# Project Management

## Overview

Project management involves organizing and coordinating team efforts to deliver features and modules effectively. This guide covers key aspects of project management for collaborators.

## Project Artifacts

Project artifacts are documents and tools that help track and manage project progress:

- **Issues**: Track bugs, enhancements, and tasks with clear descriptions and priorities
- **Project Boards**: Visualize work progress using Kanban-style columns
- **Project Roadmaps**: Plan strategic direction and timeline for development
- **Pull Requests**: Facilitate code review and merge feature branches

## Stakeholder Communication

### Working with Upstream Stakeholders
- Define clear interface requirements and specifications
- Document API contracts and data structures
- Regular check-ins to ensure alignment with project goals
- Early communication of potential technical limitations

## Team Management

### Work Allocation
- Break down features into manageable work units
- Consider team members' skills and learning goals
- Ensure clear ownership and responsibilities
- Balance workload across team members
- Understand and respect different priority levels
- Use "[Thirty Percent Feedback](https://www.kevinball.com/2016/04/25/effective-feedback-thirty-percent-vs-ninety-percent/)" concept for work in progress
- Recognize different work styles and preferences
- Account for varying energy levels and focus needs

### Progress Monitoring
- Regular status updates and check-ins
- Identify blockers and assistance needs early
- Assess when issues exceed team member capabilities
- Facilitate knowledge sharing and pair programming
- Understand each team member's preferred communication tools and style
- Respect different work environments and preferences
- Ask "How can I help?" when teammates face challenges
- Close communication loops by confirming message receipt and understanding

### Communication Best Practices
- Don't assume everyone uses the same tools or processes
- Adapt communication style to match team member preferences
- Set clear expectations for response times
- Respect different work environments (quiet vs collaborative)
- Account for different personality types and energy levels

### Escalation Protocol
- Report deadline risks promptly to project leads
- Document bottlenecks and their impact
- Propose mitigation strategies
- Keep stakeholders informed of changes

## Team Development

### Training and Growth
- Identify skill development opportunities
- Rotate responsibilities to build diverse experience
- Encourage documentation contributions
- Support peer learning and mentorship

## Planning and Estimation

### Work Breakdown
- Apply abstraction to identify distinct components
- Define clear interfaces between modules
- Consider dependencies and integration points
- Document assumptions and constraints

### Time/Effort Estimation
- Break down tasks into smaller units
- Consider complexity and unknowns
- Account for testing and documentation time
- Include buffer for unexpected challenges
- Track actual vs. estimated time for future planning

## Sprint Management

Sprints are fixed-length periods (typically 1-4 weeks) where teams focus on completing a specific set of work items.

### Sprint Planning
- Set clear sprint goals aligned with project objectives
- Select work items from the backlog that can be completed within the sprint
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable items
- Ensure team agreement on sprint scope and commitments

### During the Sprint
- Hold standup meetings to discuss:
  - What was completed yesterday
  - What will be worked on today
  - Any blockers or challenges
- Keep sprint board updated with work progress
- Address blockers promptly
- Protect team from scope changes

### Sprint Review
- Demonstrate completed work items
- Gather feedback from stakeholders
- Document lessons learned
- Update project metrics and estimates
- Plan improvements for next sprint

## Best Practices

1. Keep communication channels open and active
2. Document decisions and their rationale
3. Regular reviews of project status and risks
4. Balance [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) with delivery speed
