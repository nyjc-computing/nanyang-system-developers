# Introduction to Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of changing implementation code while keeping the output the same. It is usually done to improve readability and ease of understanding of the code, in preparation for extension or adding new features, or to improve its performance.

## Benefits of Refactoring

- **Improved Code Readability**: Clean and well-structured code is easier to read and understand.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifying complex code makes it easier to maintain and extend.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Well-organized code is easier to debug and modify.
- **Facilitates New Features**: Refactored code can make it easier to add new features without introducing bugs.

## Common Refactoring Techniques

- **Extract Method**: Create a new method by extracting a block of code from an existing method.
- **Rename Variable**: Change the name of a variable to make its purpose more clear.
- **Inline Method**: Replace a method call with the method's content.
- **Move Method**: Move a method from one class to another where it is more relevant.

Refactoring should be done in small steps, with frequent testing to ensure that the behavior of the code remains unchanged.
