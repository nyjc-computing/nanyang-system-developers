# Software Versioning

## Overview

Software versioning is the process of assigning unique version numbers to unique states of software. Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a widely adopted versioning scheme that uses a three-part version number: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- **PATCH** version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
