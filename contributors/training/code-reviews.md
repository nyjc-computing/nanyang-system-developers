# Code Reviews

## Overview

Code review is a systematic examination of source code by peers to identify bugs, improve code quality, and ensure consistency with project standards.

## Key Concepts

- **Review Process**: Examining code changes before they are merged into the main codebase
- **Review Comments**: Providing constructive feedback on code structure, style, and functionality
- **Code Quality**: Ensuring code meets project standards and best practices
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Using reviews as opportunities to learn and teach

## Best Practices

- Review code in manageable chunks

- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Be respectful and constructive in comments
- Check for:
  - Code correctness
  - Test coverage
  - Documentation
  - Style consistency
  - Potential bugs
