# CSV & JSON

## Overview

Binary data (raw bits) is often **serialized** to a standard text format when it is to be passed to another application. The other application then **deserializes** the text-formatted back to binary.

[Comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (CSV) and [JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) (JSON) are two of the most common text formats for serialized data.
