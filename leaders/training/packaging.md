# Modularisation Principles

## Overview

Modularisation involves breaking down a software system into smaller, manageable, and reusable components. This approach improves code maintainability, scalability, and collaboration.

## Key Concepts

- **Separation of Concerns**: Dividing a program into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
- **Reusability**: Creating components that can be reused across different parts of the application or in different projects.
- **Interchangeability**: Designing modules that can be easily replaced or updated without affecting the rest of the system.

## Best Practices

- Keep modules small and focused.
- Ensure high cohesion within modules and low coupling between them.
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions.
- Document module interfaces and dependencies.
