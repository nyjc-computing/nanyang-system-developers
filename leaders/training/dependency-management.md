# Dependency Management

## Overview

Dependency management is about handling the libraries and tools a project needs. This ensures everything works well together, stays secure, and is easy to maintain.

## History and Background

In the past, developers manually added and updated libraries. This was time-consuming and error-prone. With more complex projects, automated tools became necessary. For example, in 2016, a small library called `leftpad` was removed from a repository, breaking thousands of projects that depended on it. This highlighted the need for better dependency management.

## Key Concepts

- **Versioning**: Track changes with version numbers.
- **Package Managers**: Tools like npm, pip, and Maven help install and update libraries automatically.
- **Semantic Versioning**: A system where version numbers show the type of changes (e.g., 1.2.3 means major.minor.patch changes).
- **Transitive Dependencies**: Libraries that your libraries need. Managing these avoids conflicts.

## Principles of Dependency Management

- **Consistency**: Use a lock file to keep the same versions across all environments. For example, `package-lock.json` in npm.
- **Regular Updates**: Update libraries often to get security fixes and new features. For instance, running `npm update`.
- **Security Monitoring**: Check for vulnerabilities in your libraries. Tools like `npm audit` can help.
- **Documentation**: Keep a list of all libraries used and review them regularly.
