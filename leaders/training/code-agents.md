# Code Agents

## Overview

While chatbots can generate code and chat assistants help to make changes directly in the codebase, these AI tools largely handle tasks of smaller scope, limited to one or a few files.

More complex tasks, involving dependency analysis across the entire codebase, or checking for security vulnerabilities across the interaction of multiple modules, may require a multi-step reasoning process. Some tasks may also involve generating a complete application from a short problem description, with the choice of framework and implementation left entirely up to the AI.

AI tools that handle tasks of higher complexity are generally called **code agents**. Code agents differ from chat assistants typically in the following ways:

- **Scope of Tasks**: Code agents can manage more complex and larger scope tasks, such as analyzing dependencies across an entire codebase or generating a complete application from a brief description.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: They often employ a multi-step reasoning process to tackle intricate problems, unlike chat assistants that handle simpler, more direct tasks.
- **Autonomy**: Code agents can make decisions on the choice of frameworks and implementation details autonomously, whereas chat assistants usually require more user input and guidance.
- **Integration**: They are designed to integrate deeply with development workflows, automating repetitive tasks and enforcing coding standards across the project.
- **Level of Access**: Code agents typically have extensive access to the entire codebase, allowing them to perform comprehensive analyses and modifications. This level of access enables them to understand and manipulate complex interdependencies within the code. They may also be able to create databases, access usage logs, or look at the application output in order to carry out debugging without prompting.
- **Variety of Tools**: Code agents leverage a wide range of tools and techniques, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, machine learning models, and natural language processing, to enhance their capabilities and provide more accurate and efficient solutions.

These distinctions enable code agents to significantly enhance productivity and code quality in complex software development environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Static Analysis**: Examining code without executing it to find potential errors and improve quality.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically creating code based on predefined templates or patterns.
- **Refactoring**: Restructuring existing code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance without changing its behavior.
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Using artificial intelligence to enhance code completion, error detection, and optimization.

## Best Practices

- While users without any programming experience may use code agents to create personalised applications for personal use, experienced software developers using code agents for multi-user applications should always review the code agent's output for quality and security.
- As far as possible, software developers should make appropriate choices of framework, packages, or modules for the best outcome.
- While the AI agent can work autonomously given a simple problem description, requests to follow specific best practices, such as generating or updating a requirements document, can improve the agent's communication with users, and enable more consistent results when fixing bugs or adding features.
