# Project Planning

## Overview

Project planning is about figuring out what needs to be done, how to do it, and making sure everyone knows their part. Imagine you're working with your classmates to create an activity manager app for your school.

## Key Concepts

- **Understanding Requirements**: First, you need to know what the app should do. Talk to teachers and students to gather ideas and requirements.
- **Dividing the Work**: Break the project into smaller parts or modules. For example, one team can work on the calendar feature, another on notifications, and another on user profiles.
- **Setting a Timeline**: Decide when each part should be done. Set dates for when you want to finish each module and the whole project.
- **Assigning Resources**: Figure out what you need, like computers, software, and team members. Assign tasks based on everyone's strengths.
- **Managing Risks**: Think about what could go wrong, like someone getting sick or a computer breaking, and plan how to handle these issues.

## Best Practices

- Make a detailed plan with clear goals and steps.
- Share the plan with everyone involved so they know what to do.
- Check progress regularly and make changes if needed.
- After finishing, review what went well and what could be better next time.

## Example: Activity Manager App

1. **Gather Requirements**: Interview students and teachers to find out what features they need in the app.
2. **Divide the Work**: Split the project into modules like calendar, notifications, and user profiles.
3. **Set a Timeline**: Plan when each module should be completed and set deadlines.
4. **Assign Resources**: Assign tasks to team members based on their skills and ensure they have the tools they need.
5. **Manage Risks**: Identify potential problems and plan solutions.
